// SMB 1-1k
// ========

// Introduction
// ------------

// This demo is a 1kb demake of the first stage of Super Mario Bros on NES.
// To fit in the budget, there's no decoration (mountains, clouds, bushes, castle, hub), no sub-areas and no power-ups.
// There's just one enemy, and no music (it should be playing in your head anyway).
// Besides that, the map and gameplay are as accurate as possible.
// I used this map/grid for reference: https://goo.gl/nju6DR

// Every sprite of the game is reduced to a colored pixel.
// The game features a 211*15px map, and shown on a 15*13px viewport, but it is scaled up 8 times to be easier to watch.
// All the map's pixels are represented with different numbers, or "id"'s, and drawn with different colors:
// - 0: sky
// - 1: ground block / stairs / flag basis
// - 2: disabled question block
// - 3: question block
// - 4: pipe

// It was minified with Terser-online: https://xem.github.io/terser-online/
// and packed with RegPack: https://siorki.github.io/regPack.html

// Global vars
// -----------

// The global vars `l`, `u` and `r` indicate if the left, up and right arrow keys are pressed or released.
// They're declared without "var" to prevent the minifier from renaming them.
l = u = r = 0;

// The following vars are allowed to be renamed by the minifier to save bytes.
var
map = [],      // Map
scroll = 0,    // Horizontal map scroll
vy = 0,        // Mario's vertical speed
end = 0,       // Game over
n = 9,         // Pixels zoom
x = 2,         // Mario's X position
y = 2,         // Mario's Y position
intro = 24,    // Frames of introduction (black screen)
enemy = 24,    // The first enemy's X position (Y is constant: 10)
//grounded = 0 // Is Mario touching the ground? (doesn't need to be initialized)


// Helpers
// -------
// This function adds a pipe (id = 4) on the map at a given top-left position.
// The pipe will be 2px wide and as high as high as needed to touch the ground at y = 11.
pipe = (y,x) => {
  for(Y = 11; Y-- > y;){
    map[Y][x] = map[Y][x+1] = 4;
  }
},

// This function adds a "stair" of ground pixels (id = 1) at a given position.
// If the `right` parameter is set, the stair will face right (𝆲), otherwise it will face left (𝆱).
// Also, set the flag basis (x = 198, y = 10).
stair = (y, x, right) => {
  for(Y = 11; Y-- > y;){
    if(right){
      for(X = x; X < x + Y - y; X++){
        map[Y][X] = map[10][198] = 1;
      }
    }
    else {
      for(X = x; X-- > x - Y + y;){
        map[Y][X] = map[10][198] = 1;
      }
    }
  }
},

// This function detects and responds to collisions between a corner of Mario's pixel and other blocks of the map.
// The `up` parameter is set if Mario is jumping, and means that the collision that is being checked is between Mario's "top" and a block above him.
collision = (x, y, up) => {

  // If the map actually has a line at the given Y coordinate.
  // This must be checked because Mario can jump above and fall below the map.
  if(map[~~y]){

    // Test if:
    // - Mario is jumping.
    // - and the map contains a solid block at these coordinates.
    // - and this block is not already a disabled question block (id = 2).
    // In that case, cancel Mario's vertical speed and decrease the value of that block:
    // - A question block (id = 3) will become a disabled question block (id = 2).
    // - A brick block (id = 1) will become sky (id = 0).
    // - Sky (0), ground (1) and pipes (4) can't be hit from below, so they're not concerned here.
    if(up && map[~~y][~~x] && map[~~y][~~x] != 2) map[~~y][~~x]--, vy = 0;

    // Then, return the id of the block at these coordinates.
